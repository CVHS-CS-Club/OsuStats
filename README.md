# OsuStats
literally just profile stats
seemed cool to do so i did it
nothing else really other than splitting the commands, but i think its alright for now
one problem tho, can do names with spaces, need to somehow do a discord bot arg with spaces
was too lazy bc i spent all my time trying to auto refresh the tokens

The Token files are just placement
it just represents the files i have on my comp
they were previouse tokens tho lol
